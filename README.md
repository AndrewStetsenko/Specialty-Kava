**Freshly Ground Specialty Coffee on the go.**

If you love good coffee and are constantly on the go, you've probably encountered a familiar problem. You want to enjoy a high-quality, freshly brewed cup of coffee. Still, you either don't have the time to brew it yourself, or you can't find a coffee shop nearby that meets your exacting standards. Luckily, coffee science has a solution to this parrel: coffee drip bags filled with specially curated, freshly grounded, well-preserved, ready-to-use, and top-notch specialty coffee. 

The Advantages of Coffee Drip Bags:

Convenience: Coffee drip bags are a quick and easy way to brew fresh coffee. They only take up a little space in your bag. The preparation is also rather an easy thing to do: open a pack, place it firmly on top of your favorite cup of thermos, and follow a recipe on the packaging that the manufacturer usually provides. Naturally, you can roll with your own recipe and experiment. Anyway, you brew it, and in just a few moments, you'll have a cup of freshly brewed specialty coffee ready to be enjoyed.
Quality: coffee drip bags are often filled with relatively high-quality coffee since commercial or poorly roasted beans will likely result in a disappointingly bitter and otherwise tasteless brew.
Portability: Being lightweight and compact, coffee drip bags are easy to carry around. Whether you're traveling, at work, or even hiking, you can have a good cup of coffee at a moment's notice, literally anywhere you can get hot water.
Another alternative to Coffee drips is Instant Coffee.
Instant coffee has a reputation for being a quick, less delicious alternative to freshly ground coffee. But imagine if you could enjoy gourmet coffee in instant form. Maybe you're in the middle of a business trip or out exploring the great outdoors. What if you could just whip out a sachet of instant coffee, add hot water, and enjoy a gourmet experience? That's where specialty instant coffee comes in, redefining the concept of convenience without sacrificing quality. 

Being a relatively new addition to the Specialty coffee scene, both kinds of products are becoming increasingly popular.

Specialty instant coffee is a type of coffee that maintains the complex flavors and aroma of specialty coffee beans while offering the convenience and portability of traditional instant coffee. It's ideal for those times when brewing a fresh pot isn't an option, like when you're: 

- Travelling
- Camping or hiking
- On a tight schedule

With Specialty-grade coffees now available in the actual portable format, a home barista probably will mostly stay the same but will definitely become richer with fast and easy-to-brew options. 

Truth be told, it is a challenging feat to source Drip coffee bags and Instant coffee of high quality. 
But yet again, luckily, there is a company that provides these unique Slovene coffee market products. This company is [Cofftok.co](https://cofftok.co) with their online shop and neatly designed test that will help you out with finding exactly the coffee you need. 

While not a technological innovation in coffee products, Drip bags and Instant coffee made of Specialty-grade beans are indeed a new and unique experience.
